Update:
Fixed up CLSNs
Corrected a few mistakes
Lariats projectile invincibility is now CLSN based. Big and diagonal projectiles will hit 
Zangief whilst he's spinning. It's really fixed now and can hit on both sides but won't hit twice
Added some sounds
Added some new fx and removed some old ones
Fixed some animations
Added Cheap KO (5950) and Itadaki Scoop (45000) anims 
Added intro vs Warusaki3's R.Mika 
Got picky and removed a lot of palettes

Last Update:
Lariat fixed, hits wont miss opponents in guard stun and doesn't hit multiple times
New effects, 
Fixed a bug where opponents would get stuck in states if they hit Zangief out of a throw
Fixed crouching light punch, it only links into light attacks
Other minor fixes
