IV.Gameplay  |

Well, he has lot of combos, may you try simple ones, like LP, LP, Spinning Back Knuckle.And try POSSIBLES ones, also, like : Flash Kick, Reverse Flash Kick.Has lot of this kind.

The character has some super cancels and dream cancels, here the list of all.

-Sonic Boom -> Opening Gambit(No bottom-hold needed)
-Sonic Boom -> Sonic Hurricane(No bottom-hold needed)
-Opening Gambit -> Somersault Strike
-Opening Gambit -> Somersault Strike --> Somersault Slash or -> Somersault Slash, directly.
-Opening Gambit -> Total Wipeout(No bottom-hold needed)

Maybe, in future, I'll add some new Super and Dream Cancels. ;)

Have fun! :)
