 - Crack Shoot and Burn Knuckle is invunerable to normal projectiles in frames 1-7.
 - Any Geyser attack is unblockable in air.
 - Fire Kick is un-blockable in standing position, and invunerable to normal projectiles.

=====<Gameplay Notes>========================================================================================================

COMBO SYSTEM:
 - Some Normal attacks can be canceled into Command, Special and Super moves
 - Some Special moves can be canceled into Super moves
 - Canceling a Special, Super move or Custom Combo into a Super move resets the juggle points
   but also reduces its damage


CUSTOM COMBO:
 - Removes cancellable attack restrictions and gives you a lot of freedom to combo them
 - Juggle limit is lifted
 - You can only use EX Special or Super moves from the point the character starts flashing faster
   and brighter, and doing so ends Custom Combo
 - Gives you a short invulnerability window at the start
